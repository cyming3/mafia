                inspired from "detective-puzzle" games as
                well as some variety shows. "M.A.F.I.A" game
                was first introduced by me myself to my church
                fellowship, back in late 2017. Rebranded with
                logo and applying posters to new themes since
                2021.
                <br><br>
                Driven by a background story setting, players
                are given characters and various identity
                that disclose from other players, whether
                you are the "civillian" (good guy) and
                "imposter" (bad guy).
                <br><br>
                To complete the game, players not only have
                to solves the puzzles, but they also required
                to obtained clues or hints or special props
                through winning mini-games. This not only
                enrich the game from pure investigating, but
                boost up the excitement, team-building, as
                well as training observation and problem solving.
                <br><br>
                Finally, this is just a mock website for assignment.
                Although this games are real and played before at
                my church fellowship, but it definitely not distributed
                in real-life. Thank you, and I am Yong Ming, the
                creator of "M.A.F.I.A" games.
